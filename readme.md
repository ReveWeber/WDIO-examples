# WebdriverIO Example Files

Sample config files and tests for using WebdriverIO with Mocha and Chai, either through selenium-standalone (local-wdio.conf.js) or connecting to Browserstack (browserstack-wdio.conf.js) or Sauce Labs (sauce-wdio.conf.js.

`/setup/` includes a simple test to check your installation and setup.

`/test/specs/` contains all other tests, with other subfolders of `/test/` holding shared code.
